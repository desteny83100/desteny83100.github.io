    <h2> Hi my name is Desteny Duque. I am a senior in high school.I love my family as showen in the picture. that is my crazy family.
   My family probably the only thing that i cant live without other than air. I am also a cross country runner. Yes i run for fun.
   Running to me is the most claiming thing in the world. Your mind blanks out and you forget about everything around you. That 
   is the best part about running. You get to think to yourself.</h2>
